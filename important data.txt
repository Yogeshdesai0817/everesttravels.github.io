 <h1>Web content</h1>
<p>Web content is dominated by the "page" concept, its beginnings in an 
academic setting, and in a setting dominated by type-written pages, 
the idea of the web was to link directly from one academic paper to another 
academic paper. This was a completely revolutionary idea in the late 1980s 
and early 1990s when the best a link could be made was to cite a reference 
in a typewritten paper and name that reference either at the bottom of 
the page or on the last page of the academic paper.
When it was possible for any person to write and own a Mosaic 
page, the concept of a "home page" blurred the idea of a page.[2] 
It was possible for anyone to own a "Web page" or a "home page" 
which in many cases the website contained many physical pages 
in spite of being called "a page". People often cited their
 "home page" to provide credentials, links to anything that a person 
 supported, or any other individual content a person wanted to publish.</p>
